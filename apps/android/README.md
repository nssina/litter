# Android App

Native Android app scaffold with module boundaries aligned to iOS feature flows:

- `app`: Android entrypoint/activity.
- `core:network`: discovery/network primitives.
- `core:bridge`: JSON-RPC bridge surface placeholders.
- `feature:discovery`: server discovery flow.
- `feature:sessions`: session listing/resume flow.
- `feature:conversation`: turn/message flow.
